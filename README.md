## About the project

This project is a pet project! It was designed to explore and understand the QTcpServer and QTcpSocket objects. This project contains two programs (Server and Client) that communicate with each other via QTcpSocket.

**Project objectives:**

* Learning and understanding the QTcpServer and QTcpSocket objects;
* Working with configuration files using the QSettings object;
* Practical application of QT and C++.

## An example of how a software product works

1. The main window of the client side for logging into the control of the radar system
[!Main Screen Shot Client App][screenshot_client_app]]

2. The main menu is to control the radar system (after connecting). After connection, the server sends data to the client to receive data from the radar system.

4. Demonstration disconnecting the client from the server
